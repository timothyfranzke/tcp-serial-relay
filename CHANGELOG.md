## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Installation to npm Package

If you're upgrading from a previous manual installation:

1. **Stop existing services**
   ```bash
   # Stop any running instances
   sudo systemctl stop tcp-serial-relay 2>/dev/null || true
   sudo -u relay crontab -r 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. **Backup existing configuration**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/tcp-serial-relay/relay-config.json /tmp/relay-config-backup.json
   ```

3. **Install npm package**
   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g @yourcompany/tcp-serial-relay
   ```

4. **Restore configuration**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /tmp/relay-config-backup.json /etc/tcp-serial-relay/relay-config.json
   tcp-serial-relay config --validate
   ```

5. **Reinstall service**
   ```bash
   tcp-serial-relay install-service --cron
   ```

### Breaking Changes

None in this initial release.

### Deprecation Notices

- Legacy `job.js` entry point is maintained for backward compatibility but will be removed in v2.0.0
- Direct file-based configuration management will be replaced by the CLI tools in future versions
